## üßê About <a name="about"></a>

The Laravel URL Shortener is a powerful and easy-to-use web application designed to simplify the process of shortening long URLs into concise and shareable links. Built on the Laravel framework, this URL shortener provides a robust and secure solution for generating and managing short links. With its user-friendly interface and efficient backend, users can quickly create shortened URLs for their long and unwieldy web addresses.
